IDEA: Find the number of days it will take to meet the number of gems required by the user through free means, based on some parameters.

P1: Currently available number of gems(Bought thru in-app purchases, achievements or other rewards)
P2: Gem mine level.(assuming player regularly collects gems)
P3: No of obstacles in home/builder base.
P4: Gem box(optional factor)
P5: clan games(Clan Games usually run from the 22nd to 28th of each month.(give three options to select from: 20 , 50 and 100 gems)(optional)
P6: clock tower

GEM MINE
*take upto 4 decimal places , round it up to nearest 2 decimal number
Gem mine level  time for 1 gem  production per day	prod per day with clock tower once a day
Ruin/Upgrading	infinite	0				
Level 1	-	40000s	 	2.16
Level 2	-	36000s 		2.40
Level 3 -	32727s		2.64
Level 4 - 	30000s		2.88
Level 5 -	27692s		3.12
Level 6 -	25714s		3.36
Level 7 - 	22500s		3.84
Level 8 -	20000s		4.32
Level 9 -	18000s		4.80
Level 10 -	17143s		5.04

OBSTACLES
HOME BASE & builder base(approximation)
factors: no of obstacles currently present , pattern of gem obtained, 
homeBase: yes/no
builderBase: yes/no
type of obstacle doesnt matter. on average each obstacle has 2 gems. vegetation respawns every 8 hours. so 2 gems every 8 hours.(assuming user clears every obstacle as it appears.)


Clan Games: can get a max of 170 gems 28th of every month
tier 1: 20gems
tier 3: 50 gems
tier 6: 100 gems

since it will occur in the future, we cannot predict wether how the user will perform in it.
So provide the best case time wherein each month 170 gems are obtained by the user, and the worst case time , wherein each month, no gems are obtained by the user



Clock tower
can make resource production 10x faster.for fixed amount of time.

(86400+net time gained by clock tower)/time taken to produce 1 gem = prod by gem mine with clock tower once in a day

Level	Boost duration	Time gained per boost	Net time gained	Gem Mine boosted/day
1		14m		2h 6m			6720s		2.32
2		16m		2h 24m			7680s		2.35
3		18m		2h 42m			8640s		2.37
4		20m		3h			9600s		2.40
5		22m		3h18m			10560s		2.42
6		24m		3h36m			11520s		2.45
7		26m		3h54m			12480s		2.47
8		28m		4h12m			13440s		2.49
9		30m		4h30m			14400s		2.52
10		32m		4h48m			15360s		2.54


Total production per day: gems from gem mine&clock tower boost once a day+ gems from obstacles+ gems from gem mine+ gems from clan game
divide the total production per day with the required no of gems , it will give the no of days required ,convert that into days hours minutes and seconds.

P4 and P5
provide option only if time taken > 28 days
gem box frequency: no of gem boxes user assumes to get per month
options: 1 , 2 or 3


avg clan game tier: what tier does the player usually complete upto in clan games(assuming he chooses gems as rewards)
options: 0 to 7 (0 indicating dont know or dont consider clan games)
