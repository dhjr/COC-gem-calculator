IDEA: Find the number of days it will take to meet the number of gems required by the user through free means, based on some parameters.

P1: Currently available number of gems(Bought thru in-app purchases, achievements or other rewards)
P2: Gem mine level.(assuming player regularly collects gems)
P3: No of obstacles in home/builder base.
P4: Gem box
P5: clan games(Clan Games usually run from the 22nd to 28th of each month. )
P6: clock tower

P1
let numOfGems;

P2

GEM MINE
Gem mine level  time for 1 gem  production per day	prod per day with clock tower once a day
Ruin/Upgrading	0 gems		0		
Level 1	-	11h 6m 40s 	2.16
Level 2	-	10h  		2.40
Level 3 -	9h 5m 27s	2.64
Level 4 - 	8h 20m		2.88
Level 5 -	7h 41m 32s	3.12
Level 6 -	7h 8m 34s	3.36
Level 7 - 	6h 15m		3.84
Level 8 -	5h 33m 20s	4.32
Level 9 -	5h		4.80
Level 10 -	4h 45m 43s	5.04

OBSTACLES
HOME BASE & builder base(approximation)
factors: no of obstacles currently present , pattern of gem obtained, 
homeBase: yes/no
builderBase: yes/no
type of obstacle doesnt matter. on average each obstacle has 2 gems. vegetation respawns every 8 hours. so 2 gems every 8 hours.(assuming user clears every obstacle as it appears.)


Clan Games: can get a max of 170 gems 28th of every month
tier 1: 20gems
tier 3: 50 gems
tier 6: 100 gems

since it will occur in the future, we cannot predict wether how the user will perform in it.
So provide the best case time wherein each month 170 gems are obtained by the user, and the worst case time , wherein each month, no gems are obtained by the user



Clock tower
can make resource production 10x faster.

isActivated: yes/no
