NOTE *as of 19/09/2024

Obtaining gems through clan games is not considered in this calculation.If you are a person who completes clan games every month and chooses gems as rewards, the time requirement will drop significantly.

Higher the required gems,more accurate is the prediction.

Time requirement for obstacle is based on the following assumptions
1. 1 obstacle is produced every 8 hours , so 3 a day
2. each obstacle provides an average of 2gems.

In reality the gems obtained from each obstacle follows a certain sequence repeatedly
which is: 6, 0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0 
On average, each obstacle cleared has 2 Gems.

The time in seconds and minutes isn't accurate as the time in days and hours.
